TODO FUTURE:

- MARKETING: Build referral program for users. If they share their code to another user and they sign up (and complete 30 days on) a free trial, then give them a month or two free of their subscription. Call it like give a month get a month. Look into Monarch Money' verbage

- SIGN IN: Add Sign In/Up with Google Button

- GLOBAL TYPES: If missing any GlobalType when a user attempts to search for it, force an app refetch of global types

- LOGSVC: Add a search bar to find logs (try to match search text to all the fields shown of a reminder like action, custom name, time, note, family member)

- LOGSVC: add a calendar view for logs, not just scrolling by day

- LOGSADDLOGVC: build a smarter way of opening the new dropdown.
    - have it see what dropdown just finished, then progressively go through next possible dropdowns until an eligible one found.
    - (e.g. dropdown dog closed but log action already selected, so open dropdown log start date. that sort of priority system).
    - Of course don't make certain dropdowns automatically open like end date/log unit
    - Current approach isn't adaptive enough. Need one centralized processing function
    
- METRICS: Look into using SwiftMetrics to track a variety of metrics

- TIME: add 24 hour time option for displaying time

- TIMEZONES: watch for a daylight savings change
    - if a change is detected, ask the user if they want to update their reminders to reflect the change
    - this should be tracked somehow from a family level so if the reminders are adjusted for DST, then the pop-up doesn't show up again for any family member

- FEATURE UPGRADE: create a custom uialertcontroller for alarms
    - when a reminder alarm presents, have a custom view that looks more hound like
    - further, if user hasnt opened app in a while and there are a lot of reminder alarms abt to be showed, add a message if they want to see all the messages or just auto dismiss them all or disable the reminders

- NEW FEATURE: add live activities like Pup to Date
    - when creating log, user can select the stopwatch option. this starts a live activity timer.
    - if user goes home screen, lock screen, notificatio  center, the live activity timer continues and they can see it (just like the united airlines flight tracker for your flight)
    - then user can click on it when they finish an activity (e.g. walking dog) and hit stop in app, then creates a reminder of that duration

- NEW FEATIRE: add actions to notifications for reminders
    - if a user clicks on a notification for a reminder, then allow them to log, snooze, or dismiss it (just as you can in-app).
    - these options should be dynamic as it is in-app (e.g. more options for potty)
    
- from AppleIDCredential, send identityToken and authorizationCode to the server.
    - have the server then extract components from that
    - I believe that is more secure or reliable, thought I'm not sure. before trying to add this feature, investigate if its actually necessary. not sure
    
- add fields for extra dog information, these should be incorporated in some more seemless way.
    - dog icon
    - date of birth
    - sex
    - microchip #
    - license #
    - rabies #
    - insurance provider
    - insurance #
    - notes
    - we will want to restructure the add/edit dog page. as it will need to display more information.
    - this will mean a few different things: 1. remove remidners display from this page and make it only dog info 2. leave reminders and make dog info buried inside another page 3. display it all and make the page scrolling. depends. dont want the page to be cluttered

- sync familyMemberIcon, dogIcon, and dogLogImage(s) with server.
    - Once we have these, they should all be displayed.
    - in dogLog cell, show dogIcon + name & show family member icon + name (then dogLogImage(s) inside dogLog if you click on it; if we displayed that outright as well it might get too cluttered)
    - in dog cell, show dogIcon (then inside dog if you click on it to allow you to edit it)
