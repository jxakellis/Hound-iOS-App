# Hound TODOs

## üìã General (Non‚ÄìiOS Related)
- **Create a Facebook page** and join relevant pet-care groups.  
- **Redesign the website** for a more modern look and clearer messaging.  

---

## üöÄ Now

- Batch updates for logs
  - Convert LogsRequest into a batch updater (like RemindersRequest).  
  - Update offline-mode manager to send log and reminder changes in batches per dog

- Per-reminder notification settings
    - Allow users to configure notification options per reminder and select which family members are notified.
    - By default have all family members selected
    - When a family member joins the family, add their userid as a recipient to all reminders
    - When a family member leaves a fam, remove their userid from all reminders

## üéØ Future

- Websockers
    - Use web sockets to update logs in real-time across devices

- About Page
    - Brief description of me and how hound came to be
    - Picture or two
    
- Log favoriting
    - Mimic feature from DogNote
    - Have a heart in the bottom right of each log cell that can be tapped to favorite log
    - if log is liked by any person, then this whole element has a rounded background added to it (similar to how we display log note/log unit). in this whole background highlight, there is the heart on the RHS (either selected or not), then on the LHS is the initials (in little bubbles/circle) of the people who liked it
    - add ability to filter logs by favorites
    
- Referral program
    - ‚ÄúGive a Month, Get a Month‚Äù: users share a code; when a friend signs up and completes 30 days, both receive a free month. See how Monarch Money does it  
    - Build referral page that users can get a code to share with other users
    - They can also track the progress of their rewards
    - Only get reward if user actually buys subscription
    
- Google Sign-In
    - Add ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù alongside Apple ID.
    
- 24-hour clock setting

- haptics enabled/disabled setting

- dynamic error messages
    - if an error cannot be matched to one defined in Constant.Error / ErrorConstant, then create a custom one. This should pull all available info from the error returned by the server.

- Calendar view
    - Visualize logs on a calendar grid in addition to the daily scroll.
    
- GlobalTypes refresh
    - if the app encounters an unknown global type, return default type (so app doesnt crash) then clear dogmanager/everything from memory. revert to server sync page and literally redownload everything

### Metrics & Analytics
- **Integrate SwiftMetrics** to track:  
  - Daily/weekly active users  
  - Feature usage  
  - Crash and performance data

### Time & Timezones
- ****  
- **DST detection**  
  When timezone changes (DST start/end), prompt user to adjust reminders. Track per family to avoid repeat prompts.

### Notifications & Alarms
- **Custom alarm UI**  
  Replace default alerts with a branded, Hound-styled view.  Also,
- **Bulk reminder actions**  
  If there are a lot of pending reminders at once, offer a view that allows for bulk actions (e.g. See all, snooze all, dismiss all)

### Live Activities
- **Activity timers (Pup-To-Date)**  
  - Start a live Activity (e.g. ‚ÄúWalk Timer‚Äù) from the log screen.  
  - Display it on Lock Screen and Notification Center.  
  - Tap to stop and save duration as a log.

### Notification Actions
- **Rich actions for reminders**  
  In the notification, dynamically offer ‚ÄúLog Now,‚Äù ‚ÄúSnooze,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDismiss,‚Äù matching in-app options.

### Authentication Security
- **Server-side Apple ID verification**  
  Send `identityToken` + `authorizationCode` to backend for validation and secure user extraction.

### Dog Profiles
- **Additional dog fields**  
  - Photo  
  - Date of birth  
  - Sex  
  - Microchip #  
  - License #  
  - Rabies vaccine #  
  - Insurance provider & #  
  - Notes  
- **UI restructuring options**  
  1. Move reminders off the dog-edit page  
  2. Nest dog info under a sub-page  
  3. Use a single scrolling layout with clear sections

### Media Sync
- **Sync icons and photos**  
  - Family-member icons  
  - Dog icons  
  - Log photos  
- **Display in feeds**  
  Show dog photo + name and family-member icon + name in each log cell; tap to view full-size images.
