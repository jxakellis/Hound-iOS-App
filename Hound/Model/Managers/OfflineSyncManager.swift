        // Start sync-ing updates according to priority:
            // 1. deleted dogs
            // 2. deleted reminders/logs
            // 3. dogs
            // 4. reminders/logs
        
        
        // Handling no/failure responses
            // If we get a no response for something, we just try again later at some point. See above for handling no response in general
            // If we get a failure response for something, we stop trying to sync it. Attempt to perform a get request on that object to resync its current state from the server.
        
        // Keep track of every single server request made by offline manager. We need a system to delay calls to not exceed cloudflare rate limit.
